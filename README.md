TrustM365 is a **free, self-hosted** dashboard for Microsoft 365 administrators and MSSPs. Connect it to one or more M365 tenants, define a gold-standard baseline of critical configuration, and know the instant something drifts — with a full property-level diff, one-click restore, and a complete audit trail.

> **"Is my tenant still configured the way I intended?"**
> TrustM365 gives you a permanent, visual answer.

---

## What it does

Most M365 drift goes undetected. A Conditional Access policy gets quietly disabled. A guest invite setting gets broadened. An admin role gets assigned to the wrong account. TrustM365 is the safety net that catches those changes before they become incidents.

- **Pull** your live M365 configuration via the Microsoft Graph API
- **Baseline** it — choose exactly which resources and properties to monitor
- **Detect drift** automatically on every sync — property-level, not just "something changed"
- **Restore** with one click — push baseline values back to Graph per property, per resource, or all at once
- **Report** — generate branded PDF and Word reports for client delivery or internal audit
- **Alert** — push drift notifications to Teams, Slack, PagerDuty, or any webhook endpoint
- **Audit** every change — full restore log with before/after values and timestamps

---

## Features

### Baseline & Drift Detection

- **Selective monitoring** — include only the resources that matter; everything else sits in "Not in Baseline" and is ignored
- **Two monitoring modes per resource:**
  - **Properties mode** — monitor specific named fields. Only changes to those fields raise a drift alert
  - **Snapshot mode** — hash the entire resource. Any field change triggers drift
- **Property-level diff** — see exactly which field changed, from what value to what, side by side
- **Three drift states:** Drifted, Clean, Missing (resource no longer exists in tenant)
- **Baseline Active / No Baseline indicator** — clearly visible status badge on every area view
- **Per-area last-synced timestamp** — each area shows its own last pull time independently
- **Auto-restore** — toggle per area to automatically revert drift on the next sync
- **Bulk restore** — restore all drifted resources in an area with one button
- **Restore dry-run** — preview the exact Graph PATCH body before executing any restore
- **Resource groups** — organise monitored resources into named, colour-coded groups within an area
- **Baseline version history** — every save archives the previous version; restore any archived version at any time
- **Select All / Deselect All** — bulk include or exclude all resources when setting a baseline
- **Resource search** — filter by name or ID within any area

### Tenant Management

- **Per-tenant App Registration** — each tenant uses its own Entra ID App Registration, stored encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Live permission checks** — permissions re-verified on every sync; area access badges update automatically
- **Permission Sync** — on-demand re-check of all App Registration permissions from Graph; unlocks newly consented areas immediately. Accessible from ⚙ → App Registration section
- **Credential rotation** — update an App Registration secret without losing any data. Validates the new secret before saving. Accessible from ⚙ → App Registration section at any time
- **Auth failure banner** — specific, plain-English error messages for expired secrets, missing permissions, and network failures — clears automatically on the next successful sync
- **Tenant Overview panel** — users, groups, devices, app registrations at a glance
- **Tenant Insights** — Graph-based security metrics including MFA registration rate, authentication method breakdown, guest ratio, and device compliance
- **Per-tenant notes and tags** — annotate tenants for easy identification in an MSSP context

### MSSP & Multi-Tenant

- **Portfolio Overview** — all tenants in Scorecard and Matrix views with cross-tenant drift visibility
- **Bulk sync** — refresh all tenants in parallel with one button
- **Cross-tenant drift export** — CSV and JSON reports across all tenants and areas
- **Webhook notifications** — push JSON drift alerts to any HTTP endpoint on first detection or every sync. Compatible with Teams, Slack, and PagerDuty out of the box
- **Baseline Templates (Security Checks)** — Maester and CISA SCuBA-referenced security checks as a read-only assessment layer across selected tenants
- **MSSP Settings** — organisation name, tagline, logo, brand colour, report accent colour
- **White-labelling** — all generated reports carry your company name and branding; commentary label reads "YourCompany Commentary"

### Reporting

- **Tenant reports** — full HTML report with Executive Summary, Drift History, Remediation Log, Baseline Coverage, Current Configuration State, and Technical Appendix
- **Always light mode** — all reports use a professional light colour scheme suitable for printing, PDF, and formal client delivery
- **Download as PDF** — browser print-to-PDF via the in-app viewer
- **Download as Word (.docx)** — fully structured Word document with tables, formatted headings, MSSP branding, and a per-page footer
- **Report scheduling** — automated weekly or monthly report generation
- **MSSP commentary** — add plain-English context to any section before generating; commentary label carries your company name
- **Report filtering** — filter by tenant, date range, or report type

### Restore & Audit

- **Single property restore** — patch exactly one property back to its baseline value
- **Full resource restore** — restore all monitored properties for a resource in one operation
- **Bulk restore** — loop through all drifted resources in an area sequentially
- **Auto-restore** — trigger on sync automatically when enabled
- **Rich restore log** — every action logged with resource name, restore type (Property / Full / Bulk / Auto), properties restored, and error detail on failure
- **Restore dry-run** — returns the exact PATCH body without executing it

## Baseline Templates — Security Checks

The Baseline Templates section provides a **read-only security assessment** layer based on [Maester](https://maester.dev) and [CISA SCuBA](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project) guidance. It runs independently of tenant baselines and does not modify any configuration.

| Group | Checks |
|---|---|
| Multi-Factor Authentication | MFA required for all users · MFA for privileged roles · Legacy auth blocked |
| Authentication Methods | SMS disabled · Voice call disabled · Phishing-resistant method enabled |
| Guest & External Access | Guest invitations restricted to admins · MFA required for guests |
| Admin Account Protection | Admins required to use compliant devices · Global Admin count within range |
| Conditional Access Hygiene | No policies in report-only mode · No permanently disabled policies |

## Quick Start

**1. Create an Entra ID App Registration** (~10 minutes)

See [docs/prerequisites.md](docs/prerequisites.md) for the full step-by-step guide. At minimum, grant these Application permissions and consent them:

```
Policy.Read.All
RoleManagement.Read.Directory
User.Read.All
Group.Read.All
Application.Read.All
```

Note your **Directory (Tenant) ID**, **Application (Client) ID**, and **Client Secret Value**.

**2. Deploy TrustM365 locally**

```powershell
# Windows
git clone https://github.com/AntoPorter/trustm365.git
cd trustm365
npm run install:all
npm run generate:key      # generates a 64-char hex encryption key
notepad .env              # paste: ENCRYPTION_KEY=<the key above>
npm run dev               # opens on http://localhost:5173
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/AntoPorter/trustm365.git
cd trustm365
npm run install:all
npm run generate:key
echo "ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(node scripts/generateKey.js)" >> .env
npm run dev
```

**3. Register your first tenant**

Click **Add Tenant** in the sidebar. Paste your Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret. TrustM365 validates your credentials and checks which permissions are granted — showing which areas are unlocked before you save.

**4. Pull live data and set a baseline**

Click **Sync All** on the tenant dashboard. Once data loads, click **Manage** on any area card, then **Set Baseline**. Select resources to monitor, choose Properties or Snapshot mode, and save. Drift detection starts on the next sync.

> For Docker and Azure App Service deployment options, see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

---

## How Baselines Work

```
Pull live config  →  Set Baseline  →  Sync  →  Drift detected?
                                                    │
                                          Yes ──→  View diff  →  Restore / Auto-restore
                                                    │
                                           No ──→  Clean ✓  →  Generate Report
```

**Monitoring modes:**
- **Properties** — select which specific fields to watch. Only those fields are compared on each sync.
- **Snapshot** — the entire resource is hashed at baseline save time. Any change to any field triggers drift.

**Drift states:**

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Drifted** | One or more monitored properties differ from the baseline value |
| **Clean** | All monitored properties exactly match the baseline |
| **Missing** | The resource was in the baseline but no longer exists in the tenant |

---

## Drift Status Reference

| Badge | Where shown | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Baseline Active** | Area header | A baseline is set and drift detection is running |
| 🟡 **No Baseline** | Area header | Live data has been pulled but no baseline has been set |
| ✅ **All clean** | Configuration tab | All monitored resources match the baseline exactly |
| 🔴 **Drifted (N)** | Configuration tab, sidebar, portfolio | N resources have properties that differ from baseline |
| 🟠 **Missing (N)** | Configuration tab | N baseline resources no longer exist in the tenant |

---

## Permissions Reference

### Core monitoring (read-only)

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Policy.Read.All` | Authentication policies, Conditional Access |
| `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` | Directory role assignments |
| `User.Read.All` | User accounts |
| `Group.Read.All` | Security and M365 groups |
| `Application.Read.All` | App registrations and credential expiry |
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` | Intune compliance, config, update rings, EP security |
| `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.Read.All` | Mobile Threat Defense connector states |
| `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All` | App Protection Policies (MAM) |
| `AuditLog.Read.All` | Tenant Insights — MFA registration rates and auth method breakdown |

### Restore capability (write — optional)

| Permission | Enables restore for |
|---|---|
| `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` | Conditional Access policies |
| `Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod` | Authentication method policies |
| `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` | Directory role assignments |
| `User.ReadWrite.All` | User account properties |
| `Group.ReadWrite.All` | Group settings |
| `Application.ReadWrite.All` | App registration settings |
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` | All Intune policies (compliance, config, EP security) |
| `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All` | Mobile Threat Defense connector restore |

> All permissions are Application (not delegated). TrustM365 acts as itself — no user sign-in required. Read-only deployments can omit all `ReadWrite` permissions; restore buttons are hidden automatically.
